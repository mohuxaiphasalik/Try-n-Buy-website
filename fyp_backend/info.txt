I want to develop a node js-based backend server that will use the Mongoose package to connect to Mongo db atlas using its native drivers. I want you to write the code that will connect the node js backend server to that database using the native drivers method, then write a schema for user collection that contains two fields that are user email and password, then write a post and get a request to store and get users from user collection.
